# About me

![my profile picture](../docs/assets/IMG_4045.jpg)

I am a technical writer with 7 years of experience in writing user guides, release notes, API documentation, and technical references. I enjoy editing text, learning new technologies and documentation writing trends. At the moment I am interested in the “docs as code” approach. I am also interested in UX writing. In my work I try to produce quality content within estimated deadlines.

I live in Lviv, Ukraine. Would prefer working remotely, although this is negotiable.
