# About me

A technical writer since 2018. I have experience in writing user guides, release notes, API documentation, and technical references. I enjoy editing text, learning new technologies and documentation writing trends. At the moment I am interested in the “docs as code” approach. I am also interested in UX writing. In my work I try to produce quality content within estimated deadlines.

I live in Lviv, Ukraine. Would prefer working remotely, although this is negotiable.
